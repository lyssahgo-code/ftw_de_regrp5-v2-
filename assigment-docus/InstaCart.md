## üåü About the Project

This project uses the **Instacart Market Basket Analysis**, which contains anonymized information on over 3 million orders from 200,000+ users

### Dataset Used
Online grocery dataset (**InstaCart**)

### Goal of the Exercise
Transform the raw dataset into a dimensional star schema (fact and dimension tables) for analytics, implement data quality checks, and explore insights with Metabase dashboards

### Team Setup
- **Collaboration style**: divided tasks into ingestion, modeling, visualization, and documentation
- **GitHub** used for version control

### Environment Setup
- Shared **Docker containers** for ingestion and dbt builds
- Local laptops for development and testing
- Sync via shared configs and Git

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture & Workflow

### Tools Used
- **Ingestion:** dlt (done by Sir Myk)
- **Modeling and DQ checks:** dbt  
- **Visualization:** Metabase  
- **Collaboration:** Git + GitHub

### Medallion Architecture

---

## üìä Modelling Process

Goal is to design a star schema:
- **Fact tables**: order activity and product behavior (purchase frequency, reorder rates, and item sequence within orders)
- **Dimension tables**: descriptive attributes, connected to fact tables (with surrogate keys where possible)

---

## Fact Tables

### `fact_orders`
> Tracks each order by user, including timing and sequence

| Column Name            | Data Type | Notes / Links |
|------------------------|-----------|---------------|
| OrderKey               | Int64     |               |
| user_id                | Int64     |               |
| order_number           | Int64     |               |
| time_id                | String    |               |
| days_since_prior_order | String    |               |

---

### `fact_order_products`
> Stores products linked to orders, showing aisle, department, and reorder info

| Column Name        | Data Type | Notes / Links          |
|-------------------|-----------|----------------------|
| OrderKey           | Int64     | Primary Key (PK)     |

| UserKey    | Int64     | Primary Key (PK) |

---

## Relationships

### fact_orders
- **user_id** ‚Üí `regrp5_insta_dim_users.UserKey`
- **time_id** ‚Üí `regrp5_insta_dim_time.TimeKey`
- **order_number** ‚Üí sequence of orders per user
- **days_since_prior_order** ‚Üí gap since previous order

### fact_order_products
- **order_key** ‚Üí `fact_orders.OrderKey`
- **product_id** ‚Üí `regrp5_insta_dim_products.ProductKey`
- **aisle_id** ‚Üí `regrp5_insta_dim_aisles.AisleKey`
- **department_id** ‚Üí `regrp5_insta_dim_departments.DepartmentKey`
- **add_to_cart_order** ‚Üí position in order
- **reordered** ‚Üí indicates if product was reordered

### Quick Takeaways
- Fact tables **track orders and products**, including timing and reorder info
- Dimension tables provide **context**: users, products, aisles, departments, and time
- `dim_time` is normalized from numeric day/hour to standard day/time for easier analysis

## üîë Key Learnings

### Technical Learnings

### Team Learnings

### Real-World Connection
- Our work focused on **dbt modeling, data normalization, quality checks, and building marts** for the Instacart dataset
- The resulting mart tables enable insights into **customer behavior, product trends, and reorder patterns**, similar to real-world retail analytics

## üöÄ Future Improvements

### Next Steps

### Generalization
The dbt and mart workflow can be applied to any domain with **sequential or event-driven data**, such as:  
- **Retail**: predicting purchases and optimizing inventory  
- **Education**: tracking engagement to improve learning  
- **Healthcare**: analyzing patient interactions for better outcomes  
- **Entertainment**: understanding viewer behavior for recommendations

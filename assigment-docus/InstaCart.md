## üåü About the Project

This project uses the **Instacart Market Basket Analysis**, which contains anonymized information on over 3 million orders from 200,000+ users

### Dataset Used
Online grocery dataset (**InstaCart**)

### Goal of the Exercise
Transform the raw dataset into a dimensional star schema (fact and dimension tables) for analytics, implement data quality checks, and explore insights with Metabase dashboards

### Team Setup
- **Collaboration style**: divided tasks into ingestion, modeling, visualization, and documentation
- **GitHub** used for version control

### Environment Setup
- Shared **Docker containers** for ingestion and dbt builds
- Local laptops for development and testing
- Sync via shared configs and Git

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture & Workflow

### Tools Used
- **Ingestion:** dlt (done by Sir Myk)
- **Modeling and DQ checks:** dbt  
- **Visualization:** Metabase  
- **Collaboration:** Git + GitHub

### Medallion Architecture
- This exercise uses the same Medallion Architecture: the Raw ‚Üí Clean ‚Üí Mart table transformations.
- The raw tables is the ingested dataset.
- The clean tables are transformed from the clean tables through data typecasting, ensuring that the id fields are not nullable, and generally ensuring that the data is ready for mart.
- The mart is the final tables ready for front-end users, the fields are organized and distributed according to the star schema and the time table is created for easier time analysis of the dataset.
---

## üìä Modelling Process

Goal is to design a star schema:
- **Fact tables**: order activity and product behavior (purchase frequency, reorder rates, and item sequence within orders)
- **Dimension tables**: descriptive attributes, connected to fact tables (with surrogate keys where possible)

## Relationships

### fact_orders
- **user_id** ‚Üí `regrp5_insta_dim_users.UserKey`
- **time_id** ‚Üí `regrp5_insta_dim_time.TimeKey`
- **order_number** ‚Üí sequence of orders per user
- **days_since_prior_order** ‚Üí gap since previous order

### fact_order_products
- **order_key** ‚Üí `fact_orders.OrderKey`
- **product_id** ‚Üí `regrp5_insta_dim_products.ProductKey`
- **aisle_id** ‚Üí `regrp5_insta_dim_aisles.AisleKey`
- **department_id** ‚Üí `regrp5_insta_dim_departments.DepartmentKey`
- **add_to_cart_order** ‚Üí position in order

### Quick Takeaways
- Fact tables **track orders and products**, including timing and reorder info
- Dimension tables provide **context**: users, products, aisles, departments, and time
- `dim_time` is normalized from numeric day/hour to standard day/time for easier analysis

## üß© Collaboration & Setup

### **Task Splitting**

- **Data Cleaning and Validation:** Prepared and standardized raw data by removing duplicates, fixing missing values, and verifying data types.  
- **Data Quality and Testing:** Applied dbt tests to ensure data accuracy, completeness, and consistency.  
- **Data Mart Development:** Built structured fact and dimension tables with proper keys for analysis.  
- **Visualization and Analysis:** Created Metabase dashboards and validated insights against cleaned data.  
- **Documentation:** Maintained schema diagrams and Git-based documentation for project tracking.  

### **Shared vs Local Work**

- **Shared Database:** A central ClickHouse instance provided a unified data source for all team members.  
- **Local Development:** dbt models were built and tested locally, connecting to the shared database for execution and validation.  
- **Version Control:** Git branching enabled collaborative development, code reviews, and controlled integration to the main branch.  
- **Workflow Alignment:** Regular updates ensured schema consistency and smooth coordination across environments.

##  üöß Challenges

- **Collaboration:** After two weeks working in the previous group, we were regrouped, so we had to adjust to new team dynamics and communication styles 
- **Time Constraints:** Balancing remaining tasks from the previous group assignment while tackling the current assignment was challenging, but the regrouping helps us get used to working with different teammates
- **Technical Struggles:** Experienced some difficulties with dbt, particularly when merging changes and pushing updates to the repository
 
## üí° Instacart Business Questions

- **Which days of the week and time of day see the highest number of orders placed per user?**
- **What are the top 10 reordered products, and what is their average time interval between orders?**
- **What are the 10 least reordered products, and what is their average time interval between orders?**
- **Which department or aisles have the highest average reorder rate?**
- **Which products contribute the most to total sales volume (by order count)?**

## üìä Sample Dashboards
We designed our dashboards to align with each stakeholder and their business questions, with the **main objective of maximizing revenue**

### üöö Operations / Logistics
> To optimize during peak periods and target promotions during slow periods

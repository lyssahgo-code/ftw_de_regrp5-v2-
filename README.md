This project explores the **Instacart Market Basket dataset** to practice data engineering and analytics concepts

Everything will be in **ClickHouse** (our database) and visualized in **Metabase**, all set up with **Docker**

## 🛠️ Tools We’re Using  

- **ClickHouse** → Fast, columnar database for queries  
- **Metabase** → Dashboards and visualizations  
- **Docker & Docker Compose** → Makes setup super easy  
- **SQL** → For querying, cleaning, and modeling data

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. **Clone the repo**
> This copies the project to your computer
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lyssahgo-code/ftw_de_regrp5.git
cd ftw_de_regrp5
```


### 2. **Pull the latest changes**
> Always start by syncing your local copy with the online repo
```bash
git pull origin main
```
**Why:**
- Ensures you’re working on the most up-to-date version
- Prevents conflicts with other team members’ work


### 3. **Create your own branch**
> Work on own changes without affecting the main branch
```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
# Example: git checkout -b ly_branch
```
**Why:**
- Lets you work freely without overwriting others’ work
- Keeps the main branch clean and stable
  

### 4. **Make your changes**
> Edit scripts, add files, or update documentation

> Test changes locally

**Why**
- Ensures your work is correct before sharing
- Reduces bugs or errors in the shared repo
  

### 5. **Stage your changes**
> Define which changes you want to include in your next commit
```bash
git add .
# or add specific files: git add scripts/my_script.sql
```
**Why:**
- Prepares your changes for commit
- Lets you control exactly what will be saved
  

### 6. **Commit your changes**
> Save a snapshot of your changes with a short message summarizing them
```bash
git commit -m "Added scripts for clean models"
```
**Why:**
- Keeps a *receipt* of your work
- Helps the team understand what changes were made
  

### 7. **Push your branch**
> This is it~ upload your branch so others can review and merge if all checks out
```bash
git push origin <your-branch-name>
# Example: git push origin ly_branch
```
**Why:**
- Makes your changes available to the team
- Allows merging into main after review
  

### 8. **Switching branches** *(optional)*
```bash
git checkout main
git checkout <other-branch>
```
**Why:**
- Lets you check other branches without losing your work
- Keeps your workflow organized
